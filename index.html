    <p>&#8216;&lsquo;Sonic Journalism&rsquo;&#8217; is the aural equivalent of photojournalism. It describes the practice where field recordings play a major role in the discussion and documentation of places, issues and events and where listening to sounds of all kinds strongly informs the approach to research and following narratives whilst on location.</p>
    <p>Recent travels have brought me into contact with some difficult and potentially dangerous places. Most are areas of major environmental/ecological damage, but others are nuclear sites or the edges of military zones. The danger is not necessarily to a short-term visitor, but to the people of the area who have no option to leave or through the location’s role in geopolitical power structures. Dangerous places can be both sonically and visually compelling, even beautiful and atmospheric. There is, often, an extreme dichotomy between an aesthetic response and knowledge of the ‘danger’, whether it is pollution, social injustice, military or geopolitical.</p>
    <p>Places visited include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chernobyl exclusion zone, Ukraine;</li>
      <li>Caspian oil fields, Azerbaijan;</li>
      <li>Tigris and Euphrates rivers valleys in South Eastern Turkey threatened by massive dam building projects;</li>
      <li>North Wales, UK, where Chernobyl fallout still affects sheep farming practice;</li>
      <li>nuclear, military and greenhouse gas sites in the UK, including Sellafield, Dungeness, Bradwell, Sizewell, Thetford Forest, Rainham and Uttlesford;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Field recordings, photographs, conversations, scientific and other information were collected at the sites and have been used for talks, lectures, radio programs, gallery installations, publications and a book with CDs. 
      <p>The next phase of the project—entitled Sounds of Water Use and Abuse—explores the increasing importance of global water issues including material recorded from the dam projects in Turkey.</p>

        <h3 class="c-main-content-section__subhead">Chernobyl</h3>
        <p>The Chernobyl disaster of 26th April 1986, was the realisation of all our fears of the nuclear industry, leading many countries to suspend their nuclear power programmes. Two and a half decades later, nuclear power is again reasserting itself, presented by governments and the industry as a ‘saviour strategy’—a response to the far more serious threats of carbon emissions and climate change. We all face a proliferating nuclear future. What insights can Chernobyl and its aftermath offer in this new situation? What has happened to the environment, nature, the regions and the people directly affected by the disaster in the twenty five years since?</p>
        <p>On two trips to Chernobyl in May 2006 and July 2007, I made many location recordings in and around the &lsquo;exclusion zone&rsquo; in Ukraine. These include sounds of wildlife, radiometer bleeps, eerie rooms in the ghost town of Pripyat, work that still goes on around the nuclear reactors, and songs and poems of the traditional people of the affected area. Their stories are in many respects the least known of the disaster.</p>
        <p>The CD contains recordings of the sounds of work, electricity and radiometers; the abandoned town of Pripyat: Samosel villages; Chernobyl’s abundant wildlife; poems and songs by Chernobyl evacuees. Detailed track information, photos, translations from the Ukrainian of the poems, songs and conversations, plus an essay of thoughts and observations are in the accompanying book.</p>

        <h3 class="c-main-content-section__subhead">Caspian oil and UK sites</h3>
        <p>The first recordings on this CD were made in 2004 at the Bibi Heybat oilfield, on the Caspian shore just outside Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. It is one of the oldest oilfields in the world and its commercialisation by Europeans in the late 19th century signalled the start of the modern petroleum age. Extensively exploited during the 20th century by the Soviet Union, Bib Heybat is now controlled by the Azeri state with massive investments from global oil companies.</p>
        <p>It is also one of the most polluted spots on earth. Both sea and land are saturated with oil. The smell is powerful. Villages and a city are nearby. Refugees, denied lands elsewhere, graze animals on the few blades of grass that grow amongst the black pools. Fish caught from the contaminated water are eaten. But despite the environmental devastation and social injustice, Bibi Heybat is one of the most photogenic and sonogenic places I have ever visited. It looks and sounds fantastic.</p>
        <p>Most of us whose daily lives are so oil dependent have little knowledge of the places and technologies of oil extraction, or of the industry&rsquo;s effect on local environments and people. I was shocked at the extreme dichotomy I experienced between my pleasure at the stunning sights and sounds of Bibi Heybat and the knowledge of its environmental, social and political impacts. <cite>Sounds from Dangerous Places</cite> was born from these contradictions.</p>
        <p>Having chanced upon an environment so completely transformed by a century of ruthless exploitation that an entirely new one, with its own unique visual and sonic character, now exists in its place, I began to wonder if similar processes were occurring elsewhere. I was especially interested in how environmental changes are revealed in the soundscape. This led me to research the Chernobyl exclusion zone and dam building in the rivers of Eastern Turkey. I also visited, smaller but still significant sites in the UK&#8212;nuclear power stations, military bases, landfill sites, places of greenhouse gas emissions and Snowdonia where Chernobyl fallout still effects sheep farming today.</p>

      <p><cite>Sounds from Dangerous Places</cite> has mostly concentrated on environmental damage caused by the energy industries. However while visiting the controversial hydroelectric dams on the Tigris/Euphrates river systems in Turkey, parallels with another basic resource, water, became evident and suggested a new area for investigation—sonic perspectives of water usage.
      </p>
      <p>The equitable use of water has long been an issue, but today’s situation is unprecedented. Finite water resources are not only subject to ever expanding human demands, but also to the increasingly unpredictable impact of climate change. The environmental, economic, cultural and political implications are far reaching, globally and locally.
      </p>
      <p>Soundscapes of Water Use and Abuse will investigate the effect of water use on the environment and on people in places that contrast sustainable and unsustainable practice and that illustrate the interdependence of local, national and global concerns. The project aims to be collaborative, between disciplines—sound, journalism, visual arts, geography, water sciences—and with people involved at all levels.</p>

    <h2 class="c-main-content-section__heading">Field Recording as Sonic Journalism</h2>
    <p>One of the most stunning field recordings of the past decade is <cite>Starry Night</cite> by Mazen Kerbaj. Mazen is Lebanese and lives in Beirut. He describes the recording as, ‘a minimalistic improvisation by: mazen kerbaj/trumpet, the israeli air force/bombs’. It documents the sounds on the balcony of his flat on the night of 15/16th of July 2006 during Israel’s summer war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. The recording starts with small breathy sounds made on the trumpet. They are quiet, but seem very close. One listens attentively. Suddenly an explosion shatters the stillness. The sound instantly lights up the city as it reverberates off buildings and hillsides briefly revealing the panorama, as would a lightening flash. Simultaneously the blast triggers car alarms and sets dogs barking pin-pointing their positions near and far before they fade to a tense quiet waiting for the next bomb to fall. It is one of those rare recordings where sound exhibits the same power of illumination as light. Throughout, Mazen continues to play minimal trumpet, quietly creative against the violence. His recording not only documents the events taking place, but is an act of imaginative defiance in its own right. For a listener the impact is powerful. The perspective reveals the city’s geography, a major aspect of its current political context and a very personal response to the situation. It is the dramatic conjunction of these elements within a single recording that makes it so memorable.</p>
    <p>Of course this is a unique recording made in wartime. Most recordists’ subject matter is far more normal and everyday. But the power and layered elements of this recording vividly convey the situation. It is a graphic example of ‘sonic journalism’, journalism of and for the ear—the sound equivalent of photojournalism.</p>
    <p>What is sonic journalism? In radio news, current affaires and sound documentary, as on TV despite the significance of images, the dominance of speech&#8212;spoken reportage, interviews, commentary, discussion&#8212;is unquestioned. Sonic journalism is based on the idea that all sound, including non–speech, gives information about places and events and that listening provides valuable insights different from, but complimentary to, visual images and language. This does not exclude speech but redresses the balance towards the relevance of other sounds. In practice field recordings become the means to achieve this. Recordings can, of course, be used in many ways. In my view sonic journalism occurs when field recordings are allowed adequate space and time to be heard in their own right, when the focus is on their original factual and emotional content, and when they are valued for what they are rather than as source material for further work as is often the case in sound art or music. Sonic journalism can be specifically created or can refer to these qualities in recordings originally made for o  her purposes, such as <cite>Starry Night</cite>.</p>
    <p>What do field recordings offer in this context? Most obviously they give basic information about places and events by virtue of the sounds, and their sources, we identify. Language and visual images also give such information. Indeed it is arguable they do so rather more explicitly than sound. The interpretation of sound certainly benefits from a knowledge of context in the same way that captions and titles enhance photographs. However field recordings convey far more than basic facts. Spectacular or not, they also transmit a powerful sense of spatiality, atmosphere and timing. This applies even when the technical quality is poor. These factors are key to our perception of place and movement and so add substantially to our understanding of events and issues. They give a compelling impression of what it might actually be like to be there. Sound is our prime sense of all–around spatiality and listening gives us a point of ear. It enables us judge how far we are from the events and to ask how we might feel and react in the circumstances. Certainly, with recordings and broadcasts we know we are not there, but even at this reduced level there is a subjective engagement and intuititive understanding that, in my view, are field recordings&rsquo; special strength. Such elements allow sonic journalism a significant impact qualitatively different from visual images or language.</p>
    <p>Of course the news media already makes use of field recordings (probably referred to as location recordings). Indeed there has been a noticeable increase recently, particularly on BBC radio. But it is almost always as a &lsquo;sound effect&rsquo;&#8212;a burst of gunfire from Afghanistan, a snatch of national anthem on a royal visit, a line of protest song in an Arab square (all heard BBC Radio 4/World Service, May 17th 2011). They add a touch of actuality, but rarely last more than a few seconds before being faded down for the ever dominant speaking voice. Field recording&rsquo;s power of atmosphere, spatiality and timing are hardly acknowledged. This is a pity, as crews sent to news hot spots are uniquely placed to capture such material and it is our loss that they are so rarely broadcast. Very occasionally though one does get through. An especially poignant example occurs 18 minutes into Jon Snow&rsquo;s <cite><a href="http://blogs.channel4.com/snowblog/days-japan-loss-invisible-threat/14875">Tsunami Diary</a></cite> from Japan, 16&nbsp;March 2011 (Channel 4 News).<sup><a id="ftnref2" href="#ftn2" title="see footnote reference">2</a></sup> Amid the tsunami wreckage, amazingly, one loudspeaker from a devastated town&rsquo;s public address system still works. It is playing the 5pm music that marks the end of the school day. Despite the blandest of electronic arrangements the tune is easily recognisable. It is <cite>Yesterday</cite>&#8212;Paul McCartney&rsquo;s best known song of lost love and shattered dreams&#8212;here a quite surreal, and moving, comment on the destruction we see before us. Sound art, as well as sonic journalism, can learn from this clip. Field recordist <a href="http://www.delaurenti.net/">Chris di Laurenti</a> has regularly covered news events from a sonic perspective in what he calls &lsquo;protest symphonies&rsquo;, for example his <cite>Live in New York at the Republican National Convention Protest September 2&#8211;August 28, 2004</cite> and <cite>N30: Live at the WTO</cite>.</p>
    <p>These examples are sonic journalism for the listener. Equally important are the advantages for investigators. Sounds are very potent triggers for research. Attentive listening on location can reveal sonic threads running through the narratives and issues under examination and suggest unexpected questions and directions to be followed.</p>
    <p>Visiting Chernobyl in May 2006 for the <cite>Sounds from dangerous places project</cite>, my first recording inside the exclusion zone was a surprise. Our driver had stopped for a cigarette and immediately I heard the fizz and pop of electricity. We had parked beside a pylon and above the cables were crackling with use. A chaffinch sang nearby and wind blew through the pines. It was an ear catching combination so I switched on the recorder. However the sound raised a question. All Chernobyl’s reactors had shut down so where was this electricity coming from and what was it for? Later our guide explained that Chernobyl still requires large amounts of power to maintain the reactors even in their shut down state, to continue the unfinished clean-up operations and to support the thousands of people who continue to live and work in the zone. The sound recorded was electricity flowing in the wrong direction, into Chernobyl rather than out, a sonic manifestation of the massive drain on Ukraine&rsquo;s resources that Chernobyl has become.</p>
    <p>Further research led to more information about Chernobyl&rsquo;s never ending clean–up and, more widely, on what happens when a nuclear reactor&rsquo;s lifespan ends. A reactor cannot just be switched off. Even if decommissioned without incident and the nuclear core removed, decades must pass before the buildings and immediate area are radiologically safe. Maintenance and security are essential for the entire period. Chernobyl&rsquo;s exploded reactor 4 cannot be decommissioned. What remains of the melted core lies under tons of aging and cracking concrete. Repairs are constant and a long-term solution is increasingly urgent. A massive new containment structure has been proposed, but international arguments over the huge cost are unresolved. Researching this has taken time but hearing that unexpected fizz of electricity was the essential start. It is still a key memory when I’m reminded of these issues. Following sonic threads became a particularly effective research method at Chernobyl. Another led to the significance of the region’s rich folklore in trying to appreciate the disaster’s impact on rural people&#8212;the vast majority of those affected.</p>
    <p>As I write&#8212;April/May 2011, Chernobyl&rsquo;s 25th anniversary&#8212;the latest nuclear disaster is unfolding at Fukushima, Japan. Nobody knows how it will turn out, but the reactors no longer produce electricity. Like Chernobyl, there will now be Japanese pylons crackling as electricity flows the wrong way into the stricken Fukushima plant rather than away from it.</p>
    <p>The arguments for the recognition of sonic journalism as a specific discipline are not intended to downplay any other medium. Far from it. Our senses and the media that address them cover different areas of perception. We gain a much fuller picture when they are in proper balance. Sound on its own is as incomplete as visual images and language on their own. Sonic journalism makes the case for sound to contribute on an equal basis and to its strengths. How and in what forms might this happen? Mainstream radio and TV will probably be slow to innovate in this area. They anyway may not be the best means, as, aside from their own inertia, we, the audience, are equally fixed in our interpretation of them. For me the new possibilities are likely to come from new and mobile media, particularly as they bring potentially relevant technologies such as GPS, mapping, instant communications and the ability to experience virtual and real space simultaneously into contention.</p>
